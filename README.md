## Introduction

The Graph Detection Project is designed to identify and detect graphs present in images from scientific articles. This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN models, to achieve high accuracy in graph detection tasks.

## Usage

The repo contains the code we used to create the Regular Dataset and also the code used to create the Diffusion Complex Dataset
You can view the code and use it to create your own dataset under the "Data Generation" folder.

The repo also contains the entire data we used to train our model (training and test), under the Data folder.

## Model Training
Under "BestTrainedModels" there are 4 of our best performing models that we trained during our project.

To train a model used in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Organize your dataset in a format suitable for training (e.g., COCO format for YOLOv8).

2. **Train the YOLOv8 model**:

3. **Train the Faster R-CNN model**:
